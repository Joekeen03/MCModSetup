# MCModSetup
A script which automates using the SinTh0r4s/ExampleMod1.7.10 template to set up a new 1.7.10 mod. Specifically, it automatically sets the packages, several gradle properties, main mod classname, and other stuff, so you don't have to go in an manually refactor that every time you create a new mod.
